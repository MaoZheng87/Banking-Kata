# Banking Kata

Congratulations! You've just been hired by an exciting new FinTech startup that is bringing some fresh ideas to the stodgy old banking industry. The company is still in the early phases of building out its technology platform, so there's plenty of work left to be done.

On your first day, the founders gave you a huge list of features they'd love to add to the system and not much more direction than that. They're trying out a management style where engineers can self-organize and pick up whatever tasks they feel are the most valuable to the company.

The good news is that most of the codebase is pretty readable and well-tested. There are a couple areas, though, where you can tell they cut corners to get a feature out the door.

## Running the API

```sh
gradlew run
